          If you've only recently heard about Celiac disease from a diagnosis, it can be frightening at first to hear the word "disease". However, for many people, receiving the diagnosis can be the first step of a healthier, more comfortable life through treatment for the symptoms you've been experiencing.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system reacts to gluten in the small intestine by attacking the body instead of the trigger: gluten. Gluten is a protein commonly found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley. It can also be found in any number of products. Over time, undiagnosed or untreated celiac disease can result in damage to the small intestine.

          <br> 
          Vegetable is a broad term that refers to the edible parts of plants, which are usually their leaves, roots, fruits, or seeds. Vegetables are a staple food across the world and are a fundamental part of modern agriculture. 

Since they’re low in calories but high in nutrients, most health experts recommend that you consume vegetables daily. There’s a scientific consensus that a balanced, rotating diet of different varieties of vegetables is one of the best ways to source nutrients from your food starting at a young age. 

Health Benefits
Vegetables are full of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that provide many important health benefits to your body. For instance, carrots are known for being very high in vitamin A, which plays an important role in eye health, as you grow older. 

Vegetables also offer many other health benefits like: 

ImprovedDigestive Health

Vegetables are a good source of dietary fiber, a type of carbohydrate that helps pass food through your digestive system. Studies show that fiber may also improve vitamin and mineral absorption in the body, which could potentially raise your daily energy levels.

              Diabetes Control

Vegetables are particularly high in fiber, which is needed for optimal digestion. They have a low glycemic index, so your blood sugar won’t rise quickly after a meal. The American Diabetes Association recommends at least 3 to 5 servings per day of non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, carrots, or cauliflower.

Nutrition
Vegetables are a rich source of f olate, a B vitamin that helps your body make new red blood cells. Folate is especially important for children’s health and may also reduce the risk of cancer and depression.
